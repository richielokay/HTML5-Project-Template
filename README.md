HTML5 Project Template

* * * * *

This template mixes together my favorite parts of several projects to create a flexible starting point for any new design.

The foundation is [Dan Cederholm's](http://www.simplebits.com) default CSS template. Dan's file organization, comment formatting, and clearfloat solution provide a solid base.

I layered in part of the [HTML5 Reset](http://html5reset.org/) along with some tweaks to make sure that certain HTML5 elements are treated as block-level elements across all browsers.

Finally, I mixed in some typography settings and gutters from the [960.gs project](http://960.gs). All block-level elements--even the HTML5 block-level elements--are given a 20-pixel gutter by default.

The latest copy of [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com) is included, and the default index file links to a Google-hosted copy of [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com). The index file is a slightly modified version of the one included in the HTML5 Reset package.
